#Homepress

A simple approach to local development for Wordpress. Using this tool, you'll get a per-project installation of Wordpress using [Laravel's Homestead](http://laravel.com/docs/master/homestead).

Download a [zip](https://github.com/lasergoat/homepress/archive/master.zip) of the project and then `cd /path/to/homepress.

Simply run: `composer create`
